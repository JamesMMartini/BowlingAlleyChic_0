				<h2>BAD SHADERS</h2>

				<p>Quantization is a process of reducing a large set of values to a smaller set of values 
                    by matching each value in the large set to the closest value in the small set.</p>
                <p>In image processing, this is typically used to reduce an image down to a set color palette.</p>
                <p>I was too lazy to define a set color palette so instead I'm just rounding each rgba value of each pixel to 
                    0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.
                </p>
                <p>This follows my general plan to ignore the best practices and techniques in favor of just trying whatever 
                    I feel like doing and analyzing the results.

                <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

                <p>I actually think this pretty decent. It's less precise and gives me less control than 
                    normal quantization but as a cheap way of reducing the colors of an image this works pretty well.

                    You can definitely some unsightly yellow and red tones on what should be a primarily brown/green/gray 
                    image but all-in-all it did exactly what you would expect, which is pretty good.
