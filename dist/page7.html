                <p>I don't plan on using Three.js interaction much. The whole point of this is to use something other 
                    than Unity and doing interaction in this feels a whole lot like Unity but worse in every way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I <i>wanted</i> to code interaction I would use a more object-oriented system that actually <i>works</i> 
                    for interaction like, I don't know, Unity.
                </p>

                    This page is more just to prove that I can do it than anything else. I wanted to figure out how mapping 
                    events on the HTML page to Three.js scripts works, but this kind of sucks. Namely, the click-and-drag code 
                    seems to have removed your ability to highlight the text which drives me insane.
