				<h2>RIGHT THE FIRST TIME</h2>

				<p>I got sick of looking at the previous page and decided that I wanted to do quantization properly.</p>
                <p>I looked up some quantization tutorials but discovered that apparently what I did first was actually 
                    pretty much exactly how quantization is usually done, so it just looked basically the same but a little worse, actually.
                </p>
                <p>So then I did it how <i>I</i> wanted to do it and created a set palette that I matched my image to, which 
                    is what you see here.
                </p>

                <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>

                <p>I won't say that this looks <i>better</i> necessarily, but I think it at least looks more intentional 
                    than normal quantization. There's something about a set color palette that makes 
                    it interesting to look at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could have spent more time findind a suitable color palette (I think I could have chosen another gray 
                    tone and changed the dark green tone) but this works just fine as a proof of concept/proof I can do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also got better at defining variables since I had to define a vec4 array to define all my colors, which 
                    nice practice if nothing else.
                </p>
