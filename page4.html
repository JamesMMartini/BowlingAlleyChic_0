				<h2>3D WEB GRAPHICS</h2>

				<p>I wanted to do more graphics-first projects and decided that Unity was too bloated. 
                    I wanted more direct control over everything so I researched other 3D web graphics tools.</p>
                <p>Turns out Unity is the recommended one.</p>
                <p>Undeterred I decided to use WebGL directly.</p>
                <p>Turns out that's actually way more complicated than I want to deal with.</p>
                <p>Anyways, looks like Three.js is a pretty popular tool.</p>
                <p>This page was just to get the hang of creating a scene with a background, geometry, and camera.
                    There's also a basic custom shader to display a texture on the cube to learn to how to create ShaderMaterials.</p>
